This is a console operating system simulator for a project in my Industrial Informatics II class. It is intended as a way to see how an operating system works beyond what is usually seen. 
  * visualize process sorting/switching algorythms like FCFS, SJF, RR;
  * visualize memory page loading/switching algorythms
  * visualize file system operations

Initially, its supposed to handle process sorting. Then, I will build on this and create a kind of framework where my colleagues can add resources, such as memory handling and memory operations
